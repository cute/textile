/*
 * Merges changes made between base and theirs in to ours.  It is assumed that
 * base was the common starting point for ours and theirs.
 *
 * While most merge tools work at the line level this function works at the
 * byte level.  It is capable of merging where both files have changes to the
 * same line.
 *
 * Conflict markers are similar to diff3.  However, the conflict markers do not
 * appear on a line by themselves.  Since this is a byte-level merge the
 * conflict markers appear inline.
 *
 * The following sequences are not null terminated.  The length of each
 * sequence must be passed using the _len arguments.
 *
 * base - Pointer to the sequence that serves as the common base.
 * ours - Pointer to our sequence.
 * theirs - Pointer to their sequence.
 *
 * The following arguments are callback funtions called to handled merged or
 * conflicted sections.
 *
 * merged - Receives a single merged sequence.  Can be copied to output.
 * conflicted - Receives three sequences:  base, ours, theirs in that order.
 *              A section that could not be resolved.
 *
 * handlerData - A void pointer that will be passed to each of the callbacks.
 *
 * Returns true if conflicts occurred.
